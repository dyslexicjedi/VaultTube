# VaultTube

VaultTube is a video archive and player application written in Python/Flask/Bootstrap5/HTML5

## Status: 
VaultTube is current pre-alpha (hot code!), expect bugs, crashes and similar issues. Treat it like hot code, because it is, use at your own risk.

Who should use this: Alpha testers, people who don't mind "early-access" to help improve software.

## Info

## Legally: 
Software is provided as is, use at own risk.

The authors are not to be held responsible for misuse, reuse, recycled and unintended uses of content within this repository by others. Only archive content that you have legal rights to or is public domain. 

This is free software under the GPL 2.0 open source license.

### Tags: 
`latest` will be current stable build, `dev` will be experimental builds based on each commit (bleeding edge)

## Video File Name:

VaultTube only cares about the end of the file name, specifically the youtube id must be at the end of the file name with [ ] around it. Example:

`some crazy test file video[abcdefghijk].mkv`

This means you can easily import already downloaded content, not just from the download.sh script.
